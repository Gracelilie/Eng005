This lab aims to help us understand how microcontrollers interact with the real world. We first studied the general structure of the micro controller and proceeded to run a code which blinks the red light and green light.
**RED LED BLINKING:** This project controls a RED LED on a microcontroller using a push button. Pressing BUTTON1(4.1) toggles the LED. A pin number output(1.0) was used as the output. when the button was pressed, the light will turn on and when it is pressed again the light goes off. Delays were added to read the signal after a set time to prevent transmission of fluactuating signals.
**GREEN LED BLINKING:** Similar to the red lED blinking, The green LED is controlled by pressing the BUTTON(2.3) on the microcontroller. A pin number output(6.6) was used as the output. when the button was pressed, the light will turn on and when it is pressed again the light goes off. Delays were added to read the signal after a set time to clearly outline the output.
